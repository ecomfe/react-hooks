# @huse/request

Tries to provide basic capabilities to make a request inside react components.

By "request" we mean any asynchronous mapping from a input to an output, typically a HTTP fetch.

## useRequest

`useRequest` receives a request function and a param of any type, returns an context obejct containing information about the pending state, response data and errors.

```typescript
type ResponseStrategy = 'acceptLatest' | 'keepEarliest' | 'keepEarliestSuccess' | 'waitAccept';
type Request<K, O> = (key: K) => Promise<O>;
interface RequestOptions {
    strategy?: ResponseStrategy;
    idempotent?: boolean;
}
interface RequestResult<O = void, E = Error> {
    pending: boolean; // Whether request is pending, a shortcut of "pendingCount > 0"
    pendingCount?: number; // Number of pending request
    data?: O; // Response data if succeeds
    error?: E; // Reponse error if fails
    nextData?: O; // Next response data waiting for manual accept
    nextError?: E; // Next response error waiting for manual accept
    accept(): void; // Accept next data or error
}
function useRequest<K, O, E>(task: Request<K, O>, params: K, options?: RequestOptions): RequestResult<O, E>;
```

Comparing to various request hooks in community, `useRequest` tries to keep itself simple and managed to solve some essential issues related to asynchronous processes.

    {
        () => {
            const [base, setBase] = useState(0);
            const generateRandom = useCallback(
                // Delay for 1.5s and resolve with a random value
                ({base}) => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(base + Math.random()), 1500)),
                []
            );
            const result = useRequest(generateRandom, {base});
            return (
                <>
                    <div>
                        Base Value: <Slider value={base} min={0} max={9} onChange={setBase} />
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        {result.pending ? <Spin /> : <span>Generated Value: {result.data}</span>}
                    </div>
                </>
            );
        }
    }
</Playground>

### Strategy

When a second response arrives, it interacts with the previous response with the same params according to specified strategy.
We provided 4 built-in strategies to store responses:

- `acceptLatest`: The latest response always overwrites the previous one, this is the most common case, and is the default value of `strategy` option.
- `keepEarliest`: Store the first response, all subsequent responses are discarded.
- `keepEarliestSuccess`: Keep the earliest success response, discard subsequent ones, this is widely used where response is supposed to be stable, such as fetching an aggregated summary of a previous date.
- `waitAccept`: In this strategy a latest response is stored in `nextData` or `nextError`, developers are able to show a notification to user and "accept" that manually, by invoking `accept()` the latested response overwrites the previous one.

    {
        () => {
            const generateRandom = useCallback(
                // Delay for 1.5s and resolve with a random value
                () => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(Math.random()), 1500)),
                []
            );
            // Simuate situation that will request with a limited set of params
            const [base, setBase] = useState(0);
            const result = useRequest(generateRandom, {base}, {strategy: 'waitAccept'});
            // Refetch every 3s, since we have 2 base values, a notification should shown each 6s
            useEffect(
                () => {
                    const tick = setTimeout(
                        () => setBase(v => (v + 1) % 2),
                        3 * 1000
                    );
                    return () => clearTimeout(tick);
                },
                [base]
            );
            // Notify for accept
            useEffect(
                () => {
                    if (!result.nextData) {
                        return;
                    }
                    const acceptAndClose = () => {
                        notification.close('new-value');
                        result.accept();
                    };
                    const options = {
                        key: 'new-value',
                        message: 'New Data Arrives',
                        description: 'There is new data arrived, click confirm to refresh',
                        btn: (
                            <Button type="primary" size="small" onClick={acceptAndClose}>
                                Confirm
                            </Button>
                        ),
                    };
                    notification.open(options);
                },
                [result.nextData, base]
            );
            console.log(result);
            return result.data ? <div>{result.data}</div> : <Spin />;
        }
    }
</Playground>

### Idempotent

The `idempotent` option indicates whether a request is indempotent, that is it should respond with the same result if given params keep identical, usually a HTTP GET request is indempotent.

When `idempotent` is set to `true`, and a previous request with the same params is pending, `useRequest` doesn't fire another request, it reuses the previous one.

### Race Condition

The term "race condition" refers to the issue where a request may receive an unrelated response because multiple requests and responses are not in series oreder.

`useRequest` solves race condition issue by having a map of params and response, `params` are not required to be reference equal.

### Multiple Request

The `request` function passed to `useRequest` should be reference equals if they refer to the same resource,
use a `useCallback` to ensure this if it is dynamically created inside a component.

Multiple `request` function works with `useRequest`, it stores responses of different request functions in different maps.
