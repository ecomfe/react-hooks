# useHover

This hook returns a set of props to handle mouse events in order to report whether element is currently in hover state.

```typescript
interface HoverOptions {
    delay?: number;
    onEnter?(event: MouseEvent): void;
    onLeave?(event: MouseEvent): void;
}

interface HoverCallbacks {
    onMouseEnter(event: MouseEvent): void;
    onMouseLeave(event: MouseEvent): void;
}

function useHover(options: HoverOptions = {}): [boolean, HoverCallbacks]
```

The `delay` option is default to `0`, with a value less than or equals to 0 hover state will change immediately on mouse enter and leave.

<code src='./demo/useHover.tsx'>

Note that when `delay` is a positive value, `onEnter` and `onLeave` callbacks are also debounced,
once you want these callbacks to execute immediately without debouncing, compose callbacks yourself:

<code src='./demo/useHover2.tsx'>
